It is important that we understand about securing EC2. Securing EC2 has many aspects to it, and we will look at some of the important ones here. 

First of all every EC2 instance has an IP Address. IP Addresses too have a security implications. So let us first understand a few basics about IP Address in the context of AWS. 

There is IPv4 and IPv6. 
- IPv4 are of the format 10.125.10.240  
- IPv4 is the older format
- IPv4 is still the most common format used onlin
- IPv6 has a bit more lengthy format like - 1901:4546:2:300:f7ff:ef12:76fc. 
- IPv6 is newer 
- IPv6 is used for the IoT

IPs can be public or private 
_Public IP_
- A machine with public IP can be identified on the internet 
- It must be unique across the whole web
- Can be geo located easily

There are different ways to assign public IP addresses to an EC2 Instance. 
- Manually assign an IP Address to an EC2 Instance
- Auto Assign public IP Address 
- Make use of Elastic IP Address (EIP)  
  - Amazone EIP Pool 
  - Bring your own IP (BYOIP) Pool
